## Introduction
This is a simple vulnerability scanner tool written in Python.
## Features
- ### Features of Vulnerability Scanner Project:
1. **Network Scanning**: Ability to scan a range of IP addresses to identify active hosts on the network.
2. **Port Scanning**: Scan open ports on the identified hosts to determine potential entry points.
3. **Domain Scanning**: Resolve domain names to IP addresses and scan the corresponding hosts.
4. **Vulnerability Checks**: Implement modules to check for known vulnerabilities in discovered services and applications.
5. **Reporting**: Generate detailed reports summarizing the scan results, including identified vulnerabilities and recommended actions for mitigation.
6. **User Interaction**: Provide a user-friendly interface (CLI or GUI) for interacting with the scanner and viewing scan results.
7. **Customization**: Allow users to specify scanning options, such as scan intensity, port range, and timeout settings.
8. **Concurrency**: Support concurrent scanning of multiple hosts or ports to improve efficiency.
9. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle network errors, timeouts, and other issues that may arise during scanning.
10. **Logging**: Log scan activities, errors, and results to facilitate troubleshooting and audit trails.
11. **Integration**: Integrate with existing vulnerability databases or APIs to fetch the latest vulnerability information for scanning.
12. **Update Mechanism**: Provide an update mechanism to keep the scanner's vulnerability database up-to-date with the latest security advisories.
13. **Platform Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility with various operating systems and environments, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.
14. **Documentation**: Include comprehensive documentation explaining how to install, configure, and use the vulnerability scanner.
15. **Security**: Implement secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities in the scanner itself and ensure the confidentiality and integrity of scan results.
